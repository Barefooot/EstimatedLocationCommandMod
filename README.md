# LocationCommandMod
Find your location on the map by typing /location.

## Details
Location command, with directions of: 3x3 of 3x3, e.g. 'You estimate you are located: North of North-West' - means: North part, of the NW part of the map, if you divide the map to 3x3 areas of 3x3 areas.

Also based on Mind logic: 
* 0-50 : 3x3 est (e.g. North, South, NW, SE..).
* 50-70 : 3x3 of 3x3 est (e.g. North of NW).
* 70-90 : same as 50-70 AND 50-tiles rounded rough estimated-location, e.g. 1150-Longitude (x) by 1000 Latitude (y).
* 90+ : exact location 1012-Longitude (x) by 1122 Latitude (y).
